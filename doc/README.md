GT-IRB Documentation
====================

Four living documents make up the totality of the GT-IRB plan.  The _GT-IRB
Roadmap_ is the most critical document, laying out the phases of development.
The _GT-IRB Software Engineering_ document is a supplement to the roadmap.  It
lays out software engineering work that should be accomplished and suggests new
processes and tools to help the project succeed and grow.  Finally, the _GT-IRB
Enterprise DevOps_ document proposes the evolution of new enterprise-level tools
to facilitate our software engineering and testing practices.
